    * @brief  a @ref DataEntity tree, a key-value table of @ref DataEntity, which is similar as Group

    *
    *  PUT and POST are both unsafe methods. However, PUT is idempotent, while POST is not.
    *
    *  HTTP/1.1 SPEC
    *  @quota
    *   The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in
    *   the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line
    *
    *  @quota
    *  The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI.
    *  If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a
    *  modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing
    *  resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin
    *  server can create the resource with that URI."
